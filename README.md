A Django web application where a student can upload photos of their homeworks, which are then reviewed and graded by a teacher. Also, teachers can upload tests and the students can give an answer. The app allows the student to submit homeworks as images and answer as text and a teacher to view and assign grades to the submitted homeworks.
